                Some of the IVF centers are not full fledged in terms of the service portfolio and hence may not need
                all the advanced features of ARTis.
                We have designed ARTis LITE suite such smaller centers with limited operations. ARTis LITE excludes
                certain advanced features from ARTis and are made more affordable to upcoming and smaller centers.
                ARTis LITE can be easily upgraded to ARTis whenever the Centers decides to go for it.

            <p class="card-text mb-5 ">
                ARTis Witness is designed to help IVF centres ensure 100% match of Gametes to the patients concerned.
                ARTis Witness uses latest technologies to offer best in class solution that is safe and fully secure.
                IVF treatment is complex and needs an extremely controlled environment. In an IVF lab the gametes go
                through a number of steps and need to be thoroughly validated at each movement. With out a system like
                ARTis Witness, centres use double verification method, where more than 1 persons are involved in
                validation of the gamete verification and matching. However this is still prone to error. ARTis Witness
                provides a fool proof solution and eliminates anxiety and provides much needed comfort to the couples
                undergoing treatment.
